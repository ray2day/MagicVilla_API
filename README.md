# MagicVilla_API
RESTful API with .NET Core (.NET7)

After working as backend-devolper at BEE-ideas working on a project for Visual Contracts (May-Nov 2022) in December 2022 I went back to self-study again. Goals: more indepth of C# / and increasing my knowledge on building web API's. This was a short course and a recap of building an API. This time using .NET7.
